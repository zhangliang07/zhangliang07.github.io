            <h5>The reason I apply for PhD. program<br></h5>
            <p>I always have a dream to become a teacher in college. I wish to take part in research and education works because I am interested to explore unknown fields in my major and&nbsp;I am willing to help others. <br></p>
            <p>In the future, I hope to help students to improve their ability of learning and research, especially those slow students. I have many similar experiences with them and could help them more.<br></p>
            <p>On the other hand, my character leans&nbsp;more toward a stable career.<br></p>
            <p>In school days, I once got some chances to get enrolled in doctoral courses, but unfortunately I missed them. After commuting in companies for many years, the dream is not fade off. Eventually I made up my mind to apply for an overseas PhD.
                program.<br></p>
            <p>After I graduated with PhD., I plan to go back to China to become a teacher in a professional college, a regular college, or an educational organization.<br></p>
